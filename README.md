This project stems from a capstone project for UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science Program. We were interested in exploring the US Organ Donation system. Through stakeholder analysis and EDA, we honed in to primarily look at kidney organ discard rates throughout America.

There are three files in the repository:

- [Butcher_Fong_Rezvani_Organ_Donation.ipynb](Butcher_Fong_Rezvani_Organ_Donation.ipynb) - Jupyter Notebook walking through the basic analytics conducted over the past several months.
- [SAFsLinkingDiagram.pdf](SAFsLinkingDiagram.pdf) - This is a pdf that highlights how the datasets are linked together. For Privacy and compliance, we did not upload the jupyter notebooks analyzing more in depth data.
- [dataDictionary.html](dataDictionary.html) - This is the data dictionary that outlines the definition of each variable for each data set.
